Overview

Cyber Threat Intelligence analysts must be able to interrogate and fully understand their collection sources. Analysts do not have to be malware reverse engineers as an example but they must at least understand that work and know what data can be sought. This section continues from the previous one in identifying key collection sources for analysts. There is also a lot of available information on what is commonly referred to as open-source intelligence (OSINT). In this section students will learn to seek and exploit information from Domains, External Datasets, Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) Certificates, and more while also structuring the data to be exploited for purposes of sharing internally and externally.
