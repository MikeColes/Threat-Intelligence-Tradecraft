Overview

Many organizations seek to share intelligence but often fail to understand its value, its limitations, and the right formats to choose for each audience. Additionally, indicator and information shared without analysis is not intelligence. Structured analytical techniques such as the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses can help add considerable value to intelligence before it is disseminated. This section will focus on identifying both open-source and professional tools that are available for students as well as on sharing standards for each level of cyber threat intelligence both internally and externally. Students will learn about YARA and generate YARA rules to help incident responders, security operations personnel, and malware analysts. Students will gain hands-on experience with STIX and understand the CybOX and TAXII frameworks for sharing information between organizations. Finally, the section will focus on building the singular intrusions into campaigns and being able to communicate about those campaigns.
