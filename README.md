# Disclaimer!!!!!!g: this is a work in progress and I am nowhere near done
## Intent:
 * Create an opensource/free curriculum for learning threat intelligence tradecraft to include:

>  * 1: Cyber Threat Intelligence and Requirements  
>  * 2: Intrusion Analysis
>  * 3: Collection Sources  
>  * 4: Analysis and Dissemination of Intelligence  
>  * 5: Higher-Order Analysis and Attribution

 * Note: I plan on heavily modeling after/emulating content from commercially available courses

## Goals:
 * Utilize entirely free (as in beer) or OSS tools
 * Deliver via step by step guides and possibly create virtual environments/exercises to practice in
 * ETA: ~June 2018 (no real idea when this will be done)

 * Contact: If you would like to help me in this project please shoot an email to: labs@whi.io
