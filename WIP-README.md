# Threat Intelligence Tradecraft
# Intent: Create an opensource/free curriculum for learning threat intelligence tradecraft to include:
 * 1: Cyber Threat Intelligence and Requirements
 * 2: The Fundamental Skillset: Intrusion Analysis
 * 3: Collection Sources
 * 4: Analysis and Dissemination of Intelligence
 * 5: Higher-Order Analysis and Attribution

 * Note: I plan on heavily modeling after/emulating content from commercially available courses

# Goals:
 * Utilize entirely free(as in beer) or OSS tools
 * Deliver via step by step guides and possibly create virtual environments/exercises to practice in
 * ETA: June 2018

 * Contact: If you would like to help me in this project please shoot an email to: labs@whi.io
